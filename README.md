\# Cosmetic Product Demand Forecast for Tehran Neighborhoods



This project analyzes cosmetic product request trends in Tehran neighborhoods and builds predictive forecasting models for high demand areas. The analysis is divided into two main phases.

\##  1. Spatial Demand Analysis



Neighborhood request patterns are analyzed using key metrics:



\- \*\*Mean daily requests\*\*

\- \*\*Growth rate\*\*

\- \*\*Volatility\*\*



Using these metrics, neighborhoods are \*\*clustered on a map\*\* to identify spatial demand patterns in Tehran. This helps reveal:



\- Which neighborhoods consistently show high demand  

\- Areas with unstable or volatile demand  

\- Spatial groupings useful for targeting and resource planning

\##  2. Forecasting High Demand Neighborhoods



From all neighborhoods, the \*\*top five highest demand areas\*\* are selected for detailed forecasting.



Forecasting is performed using \*\*Meta Prophet\*\*, generating 6 month ahead predictions including:



\- \*\*Trend estimates\*\*  

\- \*\*Prediction intervals (yhat\_lower / yhat\_upper)\*\*  

\- \*\*Seasonality impacts\*\*  



Model performance is evaluated using:



\- \*\*MAE\*\*  

\- \*\*MAPE\*\*  

\- \*\*RMSE\*\*  

\- \*\*Coverage\*\* (interval accuracy)



This forecasting helps understand expected future demand and uncertainty levels for planning and decision making.
